Button API for ComputerCraft

This file goes in `<minecraft_dir>/saves/<world>/computer/<id>/`, where <world>
is the world your computer is in and <id> is the id of the computer (running
'id' without quotes on the computer will tell you what that is).

Use this in your program by starting with os.include("button")

Buttons stretch horizontally to fill their rows; rows stretch vertically to fit
their area, and areas must have precisely defined sizes.

Begin by calling button.open("dir"), using the same direction you would to open
a peripheral to the Advanced Monitor on which these buttons will be running.

A new area is generated by calling `button.createArea(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.  `x1`
and `x2` must be integral numbers (positions on the monitor); `x2` and `y2` may
be integers or strings.  If integers, they are takes as literal positions; if
strings, they are taken as relative distances.  Consider the following examples,
where . are spots on the monitor and # covers the defined area.
    button.createArea(2, 2, 3, 4)     button.createArea(2, 2, "3", "4")
    ...                               ....
    .##                               .###
    .##                               .###
    .##                               .###
                                      .###
Numbers may be negative; in that case it is assumed to be an offset from the
right or bottom sides of the monitor.  So `button.createArea(5, -1, "10", -1)`
creates an area from the fifth column and last row that is ten columns wide and
extends to the last row (which is where it started, so the area is only one row
tall).
